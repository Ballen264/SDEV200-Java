Module 04: Midterm - Debugging Assignment
In this assignment you will demonstrate your knowledge of debugging by fixing the errors you find in the program
below. Fix the code, and paste it in this document, along with the list of the problems you fixed.
This example allows the user to display the string for the day of the week. For example, if the user passed the integer 1,
the method will return the string Sunday. If the user passed the integer 2, the method will return Monday. This code has
both syntax errors and logic errors. Hint: There are three logic errors to find and fix (in addition to the syntax errors).
Inport daysAndDates.DaysOfWeek;
public class TestDaysOfWeek {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.
out.println("Days Of week: ");
for (int i = 0;i < 8;i++) {
System.
out.println("Number: " + i + "\tDay Of Week: " + DaysOfWeek.
DayOfWeekStr(i) )
}
}
}
package daysAndDates
public class DaysOfWeek {
public static String DayOfWeekStr(int NumberOfDay) {
String dayStr = ""
switch (NumberOfDay) {
case 1:
dayStr = "Sunday";
break;
case 2:
dayStr = "Monday";
break;
case 3:
dayStr = "Tuesday"
break;
case 4:
dayStr = "Wednesday";
case 5:
dayStr = "Thursday";
break;
case 6:
dayStr = "Thursday";
break;
case 7:
dayStr = "Saturday";
break;
}
}
}


CORRECTED CODE:


TestDaysOfWeek.java
lines 1.

DaysOfWeek.java
lines 1, 5, 14, +18, +30, +31.


LIST OF PROBLEMS FIXED:


TestDaysOfWeek.java
Spelling error on line one. "import" was misspelled.

DaysOfWeek.java
Line 1 missing ";".
Line 5 missing ";".
Line 14 missing ";'.
Line 18 added new line. Added code: break;
Line 30 added new line. added code: return dayStr;
Line 31 added new line. No new code added.


The code should run normally now. I had some trouble because my software wasn't compiling both files.
