I was unable to figure out how to use the javafx related applications.
I followed a pretty good guide but as I was unable to test whether my code would work or not, there are probably a lot of errors and coding mistakes.
As I was unable to test my code, I was also unable to learn much from what the code actually does, the best I could do was search for specific pieces of information on parts of the code.

I believe I have an okay idea of how this is supposed to work, but I don't believe I could create working code without assistance.
