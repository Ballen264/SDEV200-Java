This version should work better.
I had some spelling errors in Verison 1 that were fixed. Additionally, the program should allow you to set your own hash for encoding your messages.
The hash will act as a password that you must know to decipher the message, unless you wish to brute force the hash decoding. That is an option.

Sadly, I am still having difficulty testing my code.
I was able to grab a tutorial from mjovanovich@ivytech.edu that should act as an acceptable guide for using JavaFX.
I will be studying this guide.
